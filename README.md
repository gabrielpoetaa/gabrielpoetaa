# Hey! I'm Gabriel. 
I'm currently studying to become QA Tester. I have Liberal Arts and Graphic Design background, both of which I believe are great assets to be a successful Software Tester. On my [repository](https://github.com/gabrielpoetaa?tab=repositories) you'll find the results of the studies I've been doing to become a QA Tester.

If you have any tips or ideas that you believe would help me on this crusade, please reach out 🖖
